        <h1>Pakora</h1>
        <p>
               Pakora is one of the most famous Indian snacks that are found across the
      whole Indian subcontinent but are also appreciated in Indian restaurants
      around the globe. As such, they can’t possibly escape the Gurgaon street
      food scene. The main ingredients of a pakora differ widely and might be
      one or two vegetables, like spinach, onion, or potato, which are dipped
      into a batter made from gram flour (including also green chilies, onions,
      and spices), and then deep-fried. They are quite crispy on the outside,
      and less inside, but yummy as hell.

        <h1>Cheese momos</h1>
        <p>
Especially for the cheese lovers, these mouth-watering momos are a pure
      delicacy not to be missed. Mostly consumed in the northern parts of India,
      as well as Tibet, Nepal, and Bhutan, this flavorsome snack comes in many
      different types, but the one you should definitely try in Gurgaon is the
      cheese version. Cheese momos here are steamed and usually served with
      garlic sauce or mayonnaise, but no matter what, when the cheese starts
      melting in your mouth, it will feel like heaven on earth.

        <h1>Soya chaap</h1>
        <p>
Soya Chaap is a kind of mock meat or vegetarian meat prepared with soybean
      chunks and flour. The dough is then wrapped around wooden sticks to give a
      mock leg piece like appearance. This is called soya chaap. And it is used
      to prepare vegetarian meat-like curries or coated in tandoori masala and
      grilled to serve as a snack.

        <h1>Balushahi</h1>
        <p>
          You read this name and an image appeared in your mind, right? But no, that is not what a regular Balushahi looks like in Haryana. Although it is the same thing, prepared slightly differently. It is more on the sweeter side. People love this delicacy and usually, a local Balushahi shop is bustling with people all time of the day. This is testimony enough of its widespread popularity in Haryana.
