        <h1>Churma</h1>
        <p>
            Churma is a popular Haryanvi, Rajasthani, Bihari, Uttar Pradesi, and Awadhi delicacy from India. In Punjab, the dish is called churi. It is coarsely ground wheat crushed and cooked with ghee and sugar. Traditionally it is made by mashing up bajri or wheat flour baatis or rotis in ghee and jaggery. More desi or traditional version of churma called choorma is very popular in Haryana. Choorma is made by mashing up roti in Desi ghee and Ayurvedic sugar. It is not served with dal and lassi but mostly ghee, specially as a diet for the wrestlers sparring in the danggal of akharas. It is usually served either with a tall glass of warm milk, lassi, or with sour kadhi.

        <h1>Ker sangri</h1>
        <p>
            One of the most popular Rajasthani dishes, ker is a wild berry that is tangy and peppery while sangri is a type of long bean grown abundantly in the desert areas of Jaisalmer and Barmer. Sangri is a mainstay during drought, when little else is available as it is 53% protein. Legend has it that long ago there was a famine in Rajasthan and the villagers found these two vegetables when all other vegetation had withered away. The villagers took these vegetables home and due to the scarcity of water cooked them in vegetable oil with spices. They ate this wonderful concoction with their bajra rotis. Today they cook it with buttermilk or water.

        <h1>Dil Kushal</h1>
        <p>
            Dil Kushal is a traditional Rajasthani dessert prepared with roasted gram flour or besan and is loved by people all over the country. A piece of this delicious dessert is a must-have after dinner in most Rajasthani homes. This easy-to-make dessert can be made with regular kitchen ingredients like ghee, almonds, cashews and sugar. All it requires is some attentiveness while roasting the besan in ghee. Roasting the besan involves two steps. In the first step, the besan is roasted until soft crumbs are formed; in the second step, it should give a smooth and shiny consistency. Adding roasted dry fruits elevates the flavour of the dish and makes it irresistible.
