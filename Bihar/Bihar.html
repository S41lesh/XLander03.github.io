        <h1>Litti Chokha</h1>
        <p>
            Litti Chokha can be considered as a national dish of Bihar. It was started as a meal of poor and then was sold on carts on the street and then reached the kitchen of Bihar. Chetan Bhagat and Sonakshi Sinha tweeted about the dish. Now it has become the soul food of Jharkhand as well as Bihar. It is good for health as it requires no frying but includes all the nutrients. It is even eaten by rich people and it is inexpensive that makes it easier for poor people to afford.

We can serve it as a main dish with chapatti or naan in lunch or dinner. You can also try it with papad and steamed rice.

        <h1>Kulcha Burger</h1>
        <p>
            As we know the love for Burger in youth. But in Bihar a new concept of Kulcha was introduced to make the dish tastier. Kulcha is generally named of south Asian bread which is stuffed into the bun with vegetables. Unlike American bun Kulcha is healthier and tastier. But if you ask which one is better in terms of taste then it will be difficult to say because taste varies with people and the plate.
