      Khambir is traditional bread preferred by the locals of Leh Ladakh in the
      majority of their dishes. This bread is brownish in color with a thick
      crust baked in a pan. The bread is served with a butter tea which is
      prepared by adding a pinch of butter as well as salt. The unique taste of
      butter tea with a loaf of Khambir is the best thing you will ask for in

        <h1>Chutagi</h1>
        <p>
         Chutagi is a famous dish from ladakh, india. In Ladakh there are so many traditional dishes but first we can take chutagi because it is on the top of the list and  most likely food in ladakh.

Chutagi ladakhi food is rich and thick like pasta dishes. But the difference between pasta and chutagi is in pasta there are no vegetables and mutton are included but chutagi made with vegetables and mutton. And nutrition wise chutagi is more healthy than pasta.

It is the signature dish of ladakh and when you visit ladakh you can easily find chutagi at every restaurant and hotel. 

It made wheat flour dough shaped and with a thick soup of mixed vegetables. If you are non vegetarian then you can also add mutton on it. The ladakhi people are eaten at lunch and dinner.
