            The cuisine of Tripura is based upon non-vegetarian dishes. Most of the dishes are made from pork and chicken. It is therefore that most of the main course dishes from the state are non0vegetrian too. One of the popular dishes from the state is Chakwi. It is made from pork and bamboo shoots. To make the dish, boil water in a pan and add a little baking soda to it. Remove the foam that is formed using a spoon. Add salt, turmeric, green chili and ginger. Then add bamboo shoot and jackfruit seeds and continue to boil. Add pork and papaya now. Add rice flour paste and a little lemon. Let it cook on medium flame. Serve hot.

            Rice dish is a staple for a lot of states in India, so is for Tripura. They love eating meat and they accompany their meat dishes with rice. They have a unique way of preparing rice to bring in the perfect aroma and texture to the rice. They put in a lot of time and effort in serving the best plate of rice. Tripurians put in a little ghee, ginger, and onions to get the desired flavor. Before all of this, the boiling of rice is done by wrapping it in the banana leaves, which keeps the flavor and nutrients of rice as it is.
