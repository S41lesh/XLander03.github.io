        <h1>Bamboo chicken</h1>
        <p>
          Bamboo chicken is a dish that immediately grabs attention. Much like matka biryani, kullad chai or tandoori momo, it stands out from the crowd of endless varieties of street foods for its rustic appeal. It's not uncommon to find ingredients being cooked in bamboo hollows across various tribal communities in India. One among them is the adivasi community in Andhra Pradesh, particularly in the quiet little hill station of Araku, where in recent years bamboo chicken has become a rage with tourists and locals, alike. So much so that across Andhra, it's now a signature dish.

        <h1>masala batani</h1>
        <p>
          Masala batani is another reasonably priced and yet priceless street food that is easily available at the city’s beach roads. The snack is a mixture of chopped onions, boiled peas, a dash of lemon, and tomatoes. It is served in a cute paper cone and you will be given a slice of a dry palm leaf to use it as a spoon. Most of the vendors who sell this snack are elderly people who have been selling at a cheap price and without compromising on the quality. The famous RK Beach close to Submarine is the perfect place to enjoy your masala batani.
