        <h1> papaya khar</h1>
        <p>
            Khar (alkali) is synonymous with Assamese cuisine. Essentially, it is an exotic liquid strained from sun-dried banana skin and cooked with a seasonal vegetable like papaya(omita), water gourd (pani lau)or mustard greens (lai haak). However, due to the rare availability of banana skin khar, we may use baking soda as a substitute. Relished as a starter, one of the most popular and easy-to-cook khar dishes is prepared with papaya. The dish has health benefits and is considerably beneficial for digestion. The cooking method may vary from person to person; here’s my recipe for this simple yet delicious Assamese dish.
