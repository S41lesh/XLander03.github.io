      <h1>Street Food Craze</h1>

      <p>
        India lives and eats on its streets. And the food is not delicate
        home-cooked one passed on by grandmothers, but street food made by guys
        who need to make a living
        <br />
        <br />
        India has always loved its street food and any city you visit in the
        country will be lined with vendors selling local favorites. On the
        streets, you can find meals, desserts, and refreshing drinks like chai
        or fresh-squeezed juice. Indian street food is often spicy, sometimes
        oily, and always delicious. It's also a great equalizer with people from
        all classes and economic backgrounds lining up at popular vendors.
        Indian street food has a long history. On the streets of Delhi, you can
        visit kebab vendors who used to serve the Mughal kings. In Kolkata,
        you'll find fusion street food that was created with British customers
        in mind during colonial times.
        <br />
        <br />
        Food is a big part of Indian life, and street food is a huge and
        important part of India’s food culture. I love the fact that it is such
        a leveler — no matter what your background might be, standing at a
        popular street stall next to the other customers, you are simply people
        enjoying food. Most street food is freshly prepared to order, served
        very quickly and, best of all, extremely cheap. Not only can you buy
        snacks and light dishes to keep you going, but you can find on offer
        amazing meals, complete with a variety of flavors and components.

      <h1>Essence</h1>
      <p>
        Over the years, the street food scene in India has grown with
        popularity. According to a food website, the street food industry has
        grown with prominence because of its high demand in the food market.
        Another food website states that its market share is also expanding
        because of its emphasis on freshness and taste in food items.
        Consequently, the website also states that the industry’s business
        models have also flourished because of the business’s low investment
        requirement and high cost-effectiveness. Hence, street vendors have
        strived and are striving to prepare quality food which will entice
        demanding taste buds at a lower cost.
        <br />
        <br /><br />
        This industry has grown and preserved economies in the country.
        According to a media report, if street food stalls fold permanently,
        then the high cost to be beared by a customer and effort to find food
        which has similar value would be difficult. Furthermore, according to
        Anne Dahmen, if proper training based on legalities, hygiene, and
        preparation is administered by different authorities through various
        schemes to various street vendors across India, then the street food
        industry can be pillars of sustenance for societies. For instance, the
        Hindu also reports that under a training program carried out by the SHP
        and Dr. Reddy’s foundation, which trained several street vendors, M.
        Vijay Kumar – one of the training program’s trainees saw his sales
        increase from Rs. 800 to Rs. 1000 a day after executing new methods.

      <h1>Misconceptions</h1>
      <p>
        When somebody mentions ‘street food’ in an Indian context, you
        immediately think chaat. And yes, chaat is India’s most-famous street
        food; it is the symbol of the soul of our cities and in many of our
        metros and towns, it is the signature food.
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        The problem with this perception is that not all street food is chaat.
        Some of it is real food, solid hearty stuff that keeps labourers going
        through tough days. The reason we regard it as street food is because it
        is usually sold (though not necessarily made) on the streets by people
        who can’t afford restaurant rents to people who can’t pay restaurant
        prices. And most north Indian chaat is hard to find in the south,
        anyway.

        <br /><br />
        In most cities, street food originated as a way for poor people to feed
        themselves or as a means of providing sustenance to those who worked odd
        hours. (This is true in India as well: vada pao and pao bhaji are both
        classics of the Bombay street but started out as sustenance foods). We
        have been distracted by the associations between chaat and street food
        and need to recognise that in India, the primary distinction between
        dhaba food and street food is that the latter is made by people who are
        too poor to even run dhabas.

      <h1>The Struggles</h1>
      <p>
        Street food vendors are at the bottom end of the food chain
        (literally!), they are routinely picked on by everyone from cops to
        municipal authorities to local dadas. Most struggle to eke out a
        miserable existence only to see a month’s earnings disappear overnight
        when a corrupt cop demands hafta, locks them up or destroys their food.
        As a child, I used to be traumatised watching cops go up to street food
        vendors in Bombay and overturn their carts only because they had missed
        their weekly hafta. (And my proudest moment as a father came some years
        ago when my teenage son spontaneously went up to a weeping vendor whose
        food had been destroyed by the cops and gave him all the money he had in
        his wallet.)
