        <h1>Kosha Mangsho</h1>
        <p>
          Kosha mangsho or mutton kosha is a very popular traditional dish in Bengal, and it’s translated as sautéed meat. The gravy is slow-cooked over low flame for a very long time to get a rich, dark-brown gravy and melt-in-the-mouth mutton (goat) pieces. This thick gravy made with the strong flavors of mutton is a favorite at every Bengali household. A little high on the spice quotient, this kosha mangsho recipe or Bengali style mutton curry can be had with traditional crisp Bengali luchi or with a portion of the delicious Bengali mishti pulao. This dish is traditionally made in an iron kadai which gives it a deep dark brown color. This Bengali mutton recipe is an instant hit at every Navratri and Poila Baisakh or the Bengali New Year celebrations. There is nothing like this sumptuous mutton curry to take you through the day. If you are visiting Kolkata, a trip to Shyam Baazar to taste the iconic Golbarir kosha mangsho is a must. It’s a tiny eatery but the flavor that the mangsho it serves is unmatchable.

        <h1>Luchi-Alur Dom</h1>
        <p>
          Luchi alur dom is the preferred Bengali combination for a lazy Sunday brunch. The dish has Luchi that is similar to puris and is eaten with alur dum or aloo dom, that is a spicier and more tangy version of the dum aloo. To grab a plate of some delectable luchi-alur dom, head to Fairlie Road in Kolkata, that is a popular haunt of the lovers of Bengali street food in the city. The road has a number of stalls that sell everything from rice and dish curry to kachuris (stuffed luchis).

        <h1> Keemar Doi Bora</h1>
        <p>
          Lovers of non-vegetarian food and dahi bada will go gaga over this perfect marriage of minced meat and sweet and spicy curd. This is one of the less popular street foods of Bengal. It has a rich cultural connection with one of the most famous Bengalis in the world- Nobel Laureate Rabindra Nath Tagore and his family. The dish was an original invention of the Thakurbari as the Tagore family is popularly known, and was introduced to the world by Purnima Thakur, when she came into the possession of the Tagore family cookbook. To sample this beautiful dish, you can head to Bara Bazaar or Burrabazaar in Kolkata.

        <h1>Jhal muri</h1>
        <p>
          You can call it the Bengali version of the bhel. Jhal Muri is another street food that Bengalis swear by. It’s made from rice flakes (muri) tossed with spicy chutney and mustard oil, along with roasted lentils and coconut chunks. It’s a convenient snack to munch on, while travelling around the city in the evening, and engaging in long-winding conversations with a friend. The absolute best place to sample the jhal muri is Dacre Lane or Dacre Street in Kolkata, that has been appreciated by the WHO that claimed that the food here was the Best Street Food in the World!

        <h1>Daab Chingri</h1>
        <p>
          There’s no denying the fact that the various kinds of fish curries of Bengali cuisine are the absolute best. But if you get fed up of eating fish and want to try some other meat here, you must sample the daab chingri- jumbo prawns cooked in mustard and served in tender coconut. Oh! Calcutta is one of the restaurants in Kolkata known for the best Daab Chingri. Other things to try out at this restaurant are the nolen-gurer ice-cream and the bhapa sondesh.
