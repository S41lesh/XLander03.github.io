        <h1>PAROTTA</h1>
        <p>
          Parotta is layered flat bread that is made from Maida. It has its roots from the North Indian- Paratha. The Maida dough is stretched, rolled and finally flattened to make this delectable dish. Parotta is so famous that a Parotta stall can be seen after every other building. Parotta is mostly had with a type of Kurma which differs in every region. In some regions it is had with egg curry and in other, there is a special curry called the – Chalna to go with it. This curry is made using chicken or mutton.

        <h1>KALAKI</h1>
        <p>
          Kalaki is a type of South Indian omelet that is mostly served in Parotta stalls. This Omelet recipe is so similar to the regular one and yet so different that you will want for more. This omelet is made using whole egg and onions that are left to cook on the flame for about minute before they are taken out, so that they are only half done. This is a dish for all the egg lovers who like to eat eggs no matter the occasion. Have it after your Parotta for a fulfilling experience.

        <h1>IDLY AND SAMBHAR</h1>
        <p>
          Considered as the signature dishes of Tamil Nadu, Idli and Sambar is a match made in heaven. Idlis are nothing but a type of rice batter that is steamed in unique moulds which gives them their shape. They are the best dieting food as they contain no fat (unbelievable right?). Idlis are popular breakfast of the Tamilians and they can be seen having them on the streets before they go to work or at night.

        Sambar is lentil based stew that is made of a special mixture of spices and vegetable. Sambar is the most favorite broth of the Tamilians and they have it with absolutely everything (believe, I even have white bread with Sambar and it is delicious. You should definitely try it!). Idli and Sambar is the most famous food of the South Indian cuisine. This dish represents the South Indian Cuisine itself. The taste of Sambar is best on the streets.

        <h1>VADA</h1>
        <p>
          One of the favorite street foods of the Tamilians are the Vadas. There are different types of Vadas. Some are sweet while some are salty and spicy. But the most well-liked and flavorsome of all the vadas is the Ulundu Vada. Ulundu is the Tamil name of a type of lentil-Urad. This Vada is characteristically extraordinary because it has a hole in the middle (no one knows why.). All the vadas are either had with Sambar or Coconut chutney or both. Vadas are the most popular snack which is eaten with tea or coffee.
