        <h1>idyappam</h1>
        <p>
            Strands of Vermicelli cooked in the shape of Idlis - Idyappam is one of the most popular foods of Kerala that’s eaten both as breakfast, a snack as well as the main food at times. It is made of rice flour and is usually eaten with curries, mostly with chana curry or with egg curry both of which are a favourite with the locals. Along with most of the restaurants, street food stalls in Kerala have Idyappam or Noolappam (as they are sometimes called) as a major food.

        <p>
            The Kerala version of the parotta – the Malabar Parotta is a thick and fluffy kind of flatbread that’s made of all-purpose flour.

        <h1>pazhampori</h1>
        <p>
            Right from their homes to the food stalls on the street, the banana fritters are an old-time favourite snack with the Keralaites and understandably so – they’re crispy, yummy and you can’t just eat one! Ripe bananas are dipped in flour and fried and that’s all it takes to make this snack. In most of the cities, hill stations and towns of Kerala, this snack is one that you’ll find everywhere.
