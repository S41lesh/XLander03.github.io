        <h1>Khatta</h1>
        <p>
 A drool-worthy combination of sliced pumpkin, heaped spoonfuls of dry
      mango powder and sprinkled deep fried boondi, this Pahadi delicacy is a
      best-seller as it brings out all the rich flavours in one bite! Served
      with either roti or rice, this gravy will surely not disappoint those who
      love gorging on tangy food.

        <h1>Sidu</h1>
        <p>
 Both a vegetarian and a non-vegetarian’s delight, Sidu comes in variants.
      For the non-vegetarian, Sidu stuffed with mutton will work while for a
      vegetarian, channa fried in ghee and topped with spices would taste
      heavenly. Sidu is prepared with wheat dough that is cooked halfway on
      direct flame, steamed and set aside for the yeast to ferment. A
      health-conscious tourist will definitely prefer this over a deep-fried
      Samosa any day as Sidu is either baked or steamed but certainly not fried.

        <h1>Aktori</h1>
        <p>
  A sweet made during festivals in Himachal Pradesh, it can also be the
      perfect example of a street-food dessert after a tiring hike by tourists.
      Made from buckwheat and dollops of ghee, Aktori provides the required
      energy for tourists while out and about in Manali.

        <h1>Chole bhature</h1>
        <p>
            • This is street food that is available in most parts of North India. The
      uniqueness of this dish in this area is that it tastes very different from
      that of the other kinds of chole bhature. • The dish mainly comprises of
      steaming hot puris along with chole curry that is chickpeas. This dish has
      become so famous because it's very economical and it fills up the belly.
