        <h1>Baingan ke lonje</h1>
        <p>
          This is a traditional recipe from the state of Uttar Pradesh which is well known for it's rich and flavourful cuisine. Even the vegetarian dishes here are created using aromatic spices and ghee which make them taste Divine. Baingan ki lonje is a spicy and flavourful side dish prepared with brinjals also known as egg plants. Brinjal halves are coated with a mixture made from fried onions and roasted spices and pan cooked on low flame in pure ghee. Trust me.. even a humble egg plant tasted like a non veg kebab. You have to make and taste them to believe what I say is true.
